# Medical AI News - Fixes Applied

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Article Body Repetition Issue ✓
**Problem**: Articles were showing just the title repeated instead of actual content.

**Solution**:
- Added article content scraping that extracts 3-5 paragraphs from the original articles
- Improved fallback logic:
  - If scraping works → use scraped content
  - If Gemini AI works → use AI summary
  - If both fail → use first 300 chars of available description
  - Never repeat just the title anymore

### 2. GitHub Workflow Failures ✓
**Problem**: Workflow was using wrong environment variable names.

**Solution**:
- Updated `.github/workflows/update-news.yml` to use correct variables:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (was: `VITE_BOLTDATABASE_URL`)
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (was: `VITE_BOLTDATABASE_ANON_KEY`)
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` ✓
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` ✓
- Simplified workflow (removed unnecessary export steps)

### 3. Content Quality Improvements ✓
- Crawler now scrapes actual article content from source websites
- Falls back gracefully when sites block scraping
- Uses RSS descriptions when available
- Better source selection (focused on high-quality, accessible sources)

## How It Works Now

```
1. Crawler fetches articles from:
   - Nature Medicine RSS feed
   - Google News (2 targeted searches)

2. For each article:
   - Ranks by source quality + recency
   - Selects top 15
   - Scrapes actual article content
   - Summarizes with Gemini (or uses excerpt if API fails)
   - Finds images from article or uses stock photos
   - Categorizes automatically
   - Saves to Supabase

3. Frontend displays articles from Supabase in real-time
```

## Required GitHub Secrets

Make sure these are set in your GitHub repository (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

1. **SUPABASE_URL** - Your Supabase project URL
2. **SUPABASE_ANON_KEY** - Your Supabase anon key (for reads)
3. **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE** - Your Supabase service role key (for writes)
4. **GEMINI_API_KEY** - Your Google Gemini API key (optional, falls back gracefully)

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the crawler
node crawler.cjs

# Check results
node ensure-schema.cjs

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## What to Expect

**Good Articles Now**:
- Title: "AI Arrives in Long COVID Diagnostic and Treatment Fight"
- Summary: "AI is being deployed to help diagnose and treat Long COVID patients. Machine learning algorithms analyze patient data to identify patterns and suggest treatment options. This technology could help millions of patients..."
- Source: MedCity News
- Image: Relevant medical/AI photo

**No More**:
- Title: "Some Article"
- Summary: "Some Article Some Article Some Article" ❌

## Files Changed

- `crawler.cjs` - Main crawler (completely rewritten)
- `.github/workflows/update-news.yml` - Fixed env vars and simplified
- `src/components/NewsFeed.tsx` - Maps Supabase data correctly
- `src/components/RecentSpotlight.tsx` - Maps Supabase data correctly
- `src/components/BreakingNewsTicker.tsx` - Maps Supabase data correctly

## Next Steps

1. Set the GitHub secrets if you haven't already
2. Trigger a manual run: Actions → "update-news" → "Run workflow"
3. Check the logs to verify it completes successfully
4. Visit your website to see the new articles with proper content!

The workflow runs every 8 hours automatically, but you can trigger it manually anytime.
