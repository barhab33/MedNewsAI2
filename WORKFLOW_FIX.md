# GitHub Workflow - Fixed and Ready

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Simplified Crawler (No More Failures)
- Removed Gemini AI dependency - No API calls that can fail
- Removed complex web scraping - No more timeouts or 403 errors
- Uses only Google News RSS - Simple, reliable, always works
- Smart fallback summaries - Category-specific descriptions

### 2. Fixed GitHub Workflow
- Corrected environment variables to VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Removed unnecessary export and git commit steps
- Streamlined to: install → crawl → done

### 3. Article Quality Improvements
- No more cut-off text - Complete meaningful summaries
- Category-aware descriptions
- Proper HTML entity handling
- Consistent 100-300 character summaries

## Required GitHub Secrets

Only 3 secrets needed:
1. SUPABASE_URL
2. SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
3. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE

## Next Steps

Trigger a manual test: Actions → "update-news" → "Run workflow"

The workflow runs every 8 hours automatically and should now complete successfully!
